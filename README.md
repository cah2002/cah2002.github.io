About me

I am a second year Computer Science student in Scotland developing my skills in web programming.
Purpouse of this website
This website was created as part of an assignemnt on using Git, GitHub, GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and Markdown. The aim of creating this website was to consolidate my knowledhe of GitHub which consisted of, but not limited to, creating a repository, writing a README file, adding folders and various types of files to GitHub, using Markdown to create posts....
Whats on this Page
I decided to make this website pizza blog,  because I thought it would be a good way to practice using the Markdown language and to understand how Jekyll works. I post recipes of pizzas that I enjoy cooking at home.
