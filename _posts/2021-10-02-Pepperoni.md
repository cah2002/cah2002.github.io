# Pepperoni Pizza Recipe
### This recipe makes 4 pizzas
# Ingredients

## For the dough

  <p1> 500g ‘00’ or strong white flour (plus extra for dusting) 
  <br>1 sachet (7g) fast-action dried yeast
  <br>30ml tempid water
  <br>15g Sal t</p1>

## For the sauce

  <p1>400g can plum tomatoes (San Marzano are the best)<br>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil , plus extra to serve
  <br>1⁄2 tsp dried oregano
  <br>small bunch basil (leaves picked, stalks reserved)</p1>
  
## For the toppings
  
<p1>8 teaspoons olive oil
<br>200g Sliced pepperoni
<br>400g shredded mozzarella cheese</p1>
  
  # Method
  ## STEP 1
<p1>First, make the dough. Tip the flour into a bowl and add 300ml tepid water. Mix together and set aside at room temperature for 1 hr. 
Dissolve the yeast in 2 tbsp water and mix this and 15g of salt through the dough. Cover with cling film and leave somewhere warm to double in size for a few hours.
For a sourer flavour, leave in the fridge for at least 8 hrs and up to 24 hrs – the longer you leave it the sourer it will be.</p1>
  ## STEP 2
<p1>When the dough is ready, tip it onto a lightly floured surface and divide into four. Roll into balls and leave to rest, covered with a tea towel or 
cling film for another hour.</p1>
  ## STEP 3
<p1>Now make the tomato sauce. Drain some of the juice from the can and tip the rest into a bowl with the olive oil, oregano and a generous pinch of salt, 
then either scrunch everything together with your fingers for a chunky sauce or blitz with a stick blender if you want it smooth. Tie the basil stalks together,
bruise with the back of a knife and place in the sauce. Leave the sauce at room temperature until needed.</p1>
   ## STEP 4
<p1>To make the pizza, heat a grill to its highest setting and get a heavy frying pan. On a floured surface push and stretch one of the balls of dough out into a
circle roughly the same size as the frying pan. Slip the round onto a floured baking sheet and top with a quarter of the sauce a few basil leaves, a quarter of the mozzarella and a quarter of the pepperoni.</p1>
  ## STEP 5
<p1>Get the pan very hot and carefully slide the pizza onto it. Cook for 2 mins, then put the pan under the grill for another 2 mins until the sides are puffed 
up and the cheese has melted. Lift onto a board, drizzle with a little olive oil if you like, then cut into wedges and serve while you make the next one.</p1>
